 * Opens the main window only while the head is level (factory native-window-move §7 item 9, drone-sight v0.1.3): a
 * Planar window opens on the line of sight and perpendicular to it, so opened while looking down it stays tilted (D9),
 * and the SDK cannot turn it upright afterwards. Every open is asked for; the Stage feeds the head pitch each frame; the
 * gate answers "open now" after the head has been within [maxPitchDeg] for [dwellMs], or after [noHeadMs] without a
 * valid head pose (counted from the first such frame, not from the ask). Pure Kotlin, unit-tested (LevelGateTest).
